# GIGASECOND ANNIVERSARY
# LANGUAGE: PYTHON

# Write a function that will calculate the date that someone will celebrate their 1 gigasecond anniversary.

# Note: A gigasecond is one billion (10**9) seconds.

# The input is three parameters representing someone's birthday.

# As a convenience for celebration planning, the function should also calculate the day of the week and the number of days from today.

# The output should be an array formatted as such: ["YYYY-MM-DD", 'day_of_the_week', days_until]

# Examples:

# gigasecond(1988, 5, 15) # ["2020-01-22", "Wednesday", "1764 days left"]
# gigasecond(2015, 2, 17) # ["2046-10-26", "Friday", "11538 days left"]





from datetime import timedelta, date #A timedelta object represents a duration, the difference between two dates or times.

def gigasecond (startdate):
    return startdate + timedelta (seconds=1e9)
